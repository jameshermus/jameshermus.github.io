I am honored to share that I have been awarded the <strong> Ambizione Grant</strong> 879k CHF (~1.1M USD) from the Swiss National Science Foundation for my project <em>Confronting the Paradox of Human Motor Control &ndash; Leveraging Subtractive and Generative Models</em>. This four-year project will be hosted at the Idiap Research Institute in Switzerland, in collaboration with Sylvain Calinon and Auke Ijspeert. This marks the beginning of my role as a principal investigator (PI), with funding to recruit my first PhD student.
