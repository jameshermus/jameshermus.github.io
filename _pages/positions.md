**Supervisors:** James Hermus, PhD (Idiap/EPFL); Sylvain Calinon, PhD (Idiap); and Prof. Auke Ijspeert (EPFL)  
**Location:** Idiap Research Institute, Martigny, Switzerland  
**Start date:** September 2026 (flexible)

#### About the project

We are seeking a PhD student to join a new research project on **human motor control and robotic manipulation**, funded by an [SNSF Ambizione grant](https://www.idiap.ch/en/allnews/idiap-researcher-awarded-snsf-ambizione-grant-to-advance-human-motor-control-and-robotics) led by James Hermus.


The goal of the project is to investigate how humans regulate **impedance** during physical interaction, and how these principles can inspire **robotic control and learning algorithms**. This position bridges neuroscience, control theory, and robot learning—combining **human experiments**, **computational modeling**, and **robotic implementation**.

The student will be based at the [Idiap Research Institute](https://www.idiap.ch) (Martigny, Switzerland), as part of the [Robot Learning & Interaction Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/robot-learning-and-interaction) (Sylvain Calinon, PhD) and collaborate with the [BioRobotics Laboratory](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/biorob/) (Prof. Auke Ijspeert) at **EPFL**.

#### Candidate profile

- Master’s degree in robotics, mechanical/electrical engineering, computer science, or a related field  
- Strong background in **control systems, robotics, or machine learning**, and solid mathematical foundations  
- Interest in **human motor control, physical interaction, and neuroscience-inspired robotics**

---

#### Environment

The **Idiap Research Institute** is an independent, non-profit research foundation affiliated with EPFL, located in the Swiss Alps. Idiap offers a vibrant international research environment. PhD students are formally registered at **EPFL** one of the leading Institutes of Technology in Europe that offers extremely competitive salaries and research infrastructure.
