In the fall I served as a 50% Lecturer for 2.151: Advanced System Dynamics and Control. I hope to share some of the teaching materials on this page in the not so distant future. 

In addition, I took part in the Kaufman Teaching Certificate Program run by the MIT Teaching + Learning Lab. This was eye opening. Topics which were especially interesting to me included teaching in an inclusive way, strategies for maintain students attention, and developing effective assessments.
