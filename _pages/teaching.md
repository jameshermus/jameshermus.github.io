This fall, I served as a 50% Lecturer for 2.151: Advanced System Dynamics and Control. I hope too share some of the teaching materials on this page in the not so distant future. 

In addition, I took part in the Kaufman Teaching Certificate Program run by the MIT Teaching + Learning Lab. This was eye opening.
